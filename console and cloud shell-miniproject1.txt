LAB NAME: Console and Cloud Shell
OBJ OF THE LAB: In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

			Get access to Google Cloud.

			Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

			Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

			Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

STEPS
- To Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

	- To Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell. use the following command 
		gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>; note that the BucketName is the name you assign to your bucket and it should be globally unique(i.e it can't be shared)


	- Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.
	1. To Upload a file into a cloud bucket use the following command
		gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]; note that MY_FILE should be replaced with the name of the file being uploaded and BUCKET_NAME be replaced with the unque name of the bucket.

	-To Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell
	1. it is required to state specific values such as the Region, the Zone and the Project ID. 
	for the Region; 
	- List the available regions
		gcloud compute regions list

	- Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with your choice of region.
		INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]

	- Verify the environment variable
		echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

	- Create a subdirectory to store the environment variable
		mkdir infraclass

	- Create a file called config in infraclass directory
		touch infraclass/config

	- Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file
		echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

	- Create an environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID. You can find the project ID on the GCP Console Home page.
		INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

	- Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file
		echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

	- Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set
		source infraclass/config
		echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

To Modify the bash profile and create persistence
	- Edit the shell profile with the following command:
		nano .profile

	- Add the following line to the end of the file:
		source infraclass/config
	- save the file, and exit nano, then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.
	
	- Then Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:
		echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
